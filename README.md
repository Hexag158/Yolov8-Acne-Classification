# Yolov8-Acne-classification
## Background

As part of our project to develop an app that can accurately detect and classify acne, I have been looking for various models to achieve this goal. After doing some research, I found that YOLOv8 can be the one. So, this repository showcases my work on using YOLOv8 for acne classification.


## Important notice
Since my laptop was not strong enough to train and test the model, I changed to Google Collab. Therefore, this repository just contains the code I used.
